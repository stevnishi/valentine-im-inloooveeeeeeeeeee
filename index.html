                <p>Happy valentine my loooveeeee. Have you ever wondered why i keep calling you with "my" no matter whats the nickname? cause i want you to know that you are mine and so im all yours too. I want you to know that i never joke around when i said "I love you" cause every time i did, then i mean it. Loving you become a special part in my life, filling the missing piece i had been seeking for.</p>
